# Travel-planning-project
Traveling with a group of friends is very fun, but can be difficult to coordinate. My travel app will take the stress out of planning a group trip by allowing multiple users to interact and collaborate on planning their trip. Once a trip has been decided on, users can start by creating a new trip and adding in their trip buddies. The app will generate a list of top rated activities and restaurants for users to explore and add to their itinerary. Users also have the option of using the search bar to find their own activities. Once activities are added to the itinerary, users can edit the date and times to their liking. If users have trouble deciding on an activity or time, a poll can be made and all users can vote on their choice. In addition, users have the option to assign tasks to other users to keep each other organized.
